Changelog
*********

See the list of changes for a specific release of the Axon NPU software.

Release 1.2.0  16 Apr 2026
==========================

* Added:

  * Compiler release 1.2.0
  * Support for ``v3.3.0-preview2`` tag of ``sdk-nrf`` (``SHA-1 ede152ec21``).
 
    .. note::
      The compiler was tested and built with SDK toolchain version v3.2.0.
      You should use this version for stable builds.

  * Support for multiple outputs in a model.
  * Support CPU operator ``RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR``.
  *  ``static_assert`` in compiled model header files to verify that the interlayer buffer is allocated enough space to accommodate the model.
  *  Compatibility check so that models report a minimum supported Axon version, preventing models compiled with new features from being run on an older version of the driver that does not support these features.
  * Option to print a histogram of bit differences between Axon inference and TFLite inference.


* Fixed:

  * Quantization multiplier misapplied under some circumstances when one input to an Add operation is packed and the other is unpacked. You must recompile models to apply this fix.


Compatibility
=============

* Older model versions are compatible with the latest driver. 
  You should recompile models using the Add operator.
* New model versions are compatible with older driver versions if they do not include multiple outputs or the ``RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR`` operation.

  * Older driver versions will ignore all but the first output if a model has multiple outputs.
  * Older driver versions will not compile models with the ``RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR`` operation.

Release 1.1.0  19 Mar 2026
===========================

* Added:

  * Compiler release 1.1.0.
  * Support for the ``v3.3.0-preview2`` tag of ``sdk-nrf`` (``SHA-1 ede152ec21``).
   
    .. note::
       The compiler was tested and built with SDK toolchain version v3.2.0.
       You should use this version for stable builds.
   
  * TFLite v2.19 as the officially supported version of TFLite. 
    Version 2.15 should still work.
  * Build support for ``nRF54lm20b``, replacing ``nRF54lm20a``. 
    The new board name is ``nrf54lm20dk/nrf54lm20b/cpuapp`` in the build command.

* Fixed:

  * Fully-connected layers with up to 2048 input length and 1024 output length now work correctly with TFLite 2.19. 
    The previous version supported up to 2046 and 512, respectively.
  * Sigmoid and Tanh after fully-connected layers now work correctly with TFLite 2.19.

Release 1.0.1  05 Mar 2026
==========================

* Added:

  * Compiler release 1.0.1

  .. note::
     The compiler was tested and built with SDK toolchain version v3.2.0.
     You should use this version for stable builds.

* Fixed:

  * Compiler now correctly handles a fully-connected layer followed by softmax when the fully-connected layer uses per-channel weight quantization (TensorFlow v2.19).

Known issues
------------

There are no reported known issues for this release.

Release 1.0.0  03 Mar 2026
==========================

This is the first public release of the Axon NPU software.

* Added:

  * Compiler release v1.0.0.
  * Support for v3.3.0-preview tag of the ``sdk-nrf`` (``SHA-1 ede152ec21``).

  .. note::
     The compiler was tested and built with SDK toolchain version v3.2.0.
     You should use this version for stable builds.

  * Arbitrary reshape operation.

* Updated:

  * Licenses to public Nordic license ``SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Nordic-5-Clause``

* Fixed:

  * Softmax no longer specifies unpacked output.
    Affects a small number of models.

Known issues
------------

There are no reported known issues for this release.

Release 0.7.0  17 Feb 2026
==========================

* Added:

  * Compiler release v0.2.0.
  * Support for the ``main`` branch of ``sdk-nrf`` (tested with ``SHA-1 860c808db9``).

  .. note::
     The compiler was tested and built with SDK toolchain version v3.2.0.
     You should use this version for stable builds.

* Updated:

  * Modified the source tree to match ``sdk-edge-ai`` repository.
  * Improved performance in compiler and simulator when performing inference.

* Fixed:

  * Compiler now checks for dilation on depthwise convolution and returns errors.

Known issues
------------

Current release has the following known issues:

  * ADD operation with broadcast on both height and width axes is not supported when both inputs are dynamic (outputs from previous layers).
  * Per-layer testing in unit tests is not supported due to compilation errors caused by incompatible types.
